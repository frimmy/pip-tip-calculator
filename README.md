Tip Calculator in Python

This was my first PIP project. Already learning new things I can do with the Python Optparse module. 

1. ver1: simple script to calc tip based on inputs in the script
2. ver2: used raw_input for user input (my favorite)
  - didn't handle for when users didn't enter arguments correctly
3. ver3: used sys.argv to access the list of arguments entered
4. ver4: used the deprecated python module optparse

Looking forward to making more robust python apps(for the web!)
